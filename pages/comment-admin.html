<h2>Comment admin</h2>

<p>
	In this section, we'll allow authorised users to delete comments from posts. To kick us
	off, here's a nice item of refactoring &mdash; the comments list within article pages is quite
	large, and it would be more modular to store it in a separate file.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Move comments markup to separate template file') ?>

<p>
	Let us now add a delete button next to comments on blog posts, for authorised users only.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add delete button to comments for auth users') ?>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="critical note">
		This page is not finished.
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<p>Make changes to pave way for determining which form is being used</p>
<?php renderDiffFromComment('Make changes to pave way for determining which form is being used') ?>

<p>Move logic to function, to make room for action test</p>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
