<h2>Comment admin</h2>

<p>
	In this section, we'll allow authorised users to delete comments from posts. To kick us
	off, here's a nice item of refactoring &mdash; the comments list within article pages is quite
	large, and it would be more modular to store it in a separate file.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Move comments markup to separate template file') ?>

<p>
	Let us now add a delete button next to comments on blog posts, for authorised users only. I've
	added a bit of extra CSS to get it to float to the right-hand side.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add delete button to comments for auth users') ?>

<p>
	Since we want to do more than one thing with comments (add and delete), we need to
	make a change to explain what we are doing within the form submission. To do this, I've used
	the query string, which sends these items of information:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The primary key of the post (<code>post_id</code>) upon which a comment is being added or
		deleted</li>
	<li>A name for the action (<code>add-comment</code> and <code>delete-comment</code>), which
		can be read by our code to determine what the user wishes to do</li>
</ul>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Make changes to pave way for determining which form is being used') ?>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="comment note">
		We could add in a comment against the new line in <span class="filename">view-post.php</span>
		to explain that this new function will redirect upon success.
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<p>
	Let us now make some room in our view post page, by moving some logic to a new function.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Move logic to function, to make room for action test') ?>

<p>
	We now need to read the action key we set up, so we can decide what feature to call.
	If the user is deleting a comment, the new function <code>deleteComment</code> is called;
	although we could just delete by <code>comment.id</code>, to be sure of deleting the right
	thing we filter additionally by <code>comment.post_id</code>.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Get the delete comment feature working') ?>

<p>Add new comment delete function at the same level of abstraction as comment adding</p>
<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add new comment delete function at the same level of abstraction as comment adding') ?>
