<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	In this tutorial, I'll present how to write a simple blog system, using the PHP language and
	the Apache web server. For the database, we'll use SQLite, to keep things simple. Don't worry
	if these terms don't mean anything yet, that's okay. I'm assuming readers are familiar
	with how to use their computer, but perhaps have not programmed before. That said, even a
	beginner's tutorial can get non-trivial quickly, so if you are brand new to programming, you
	may wish to research unfamiliar keywords (usually on the PHP website).
</p>

<p>
	The application we will build together was built prior to writing the tutorial. The text is
	therefore written around the way I think development happens in real life; some steps may
	introduce bugs, or be written in ways the purist might consider non-ideal. However, for the most
	part, these problems will be ironed out as we go. At the end of this project, we'll have a
	<b>functional</b>, <b>maintainable</b> and <b>secure</b> application, but there'll be much
	that can still be improved on (which will likely make for a subsequent tutorial).
</p>

<p>
	If you are new to programming, it is possible that you might feel somewhat lost as you work
	through the material. Whilst any prior practice will always help, the before-and-after code
	samples should see you right through to the end, even if you don't initially understand every
	step. You should find that some of this will sink in, and will contribute to your future "aha"
	moment, even if it is daunting at the start. The elation of getting it working will, I hope,
	encourage you to dive even deeper into programming. Enjoy the ride!

		<p>A word about PHP tutorials on the web</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		To become proficient with a programming language, it makes sense to obtain your learning
		materials from as wide a source as possible. PHP owes its success, I think, to its very
		low barriers to entry, but that situation has given birth to plenty of tutorials on the
		Internet that make two fundamental errors.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first is that the <code>mysql_</code> library is still in use (a <em>library</em> is
		just a package of useful functions). This has been a staple of database access
		in PHP applications for some ten years, but has now been superceded by newer systems.
		In particular, libraries such as PDO and mysqli offer <em>parameterisation</em>, a feature
		that helps prevent miscreants and ne'erdowells from cracking system security.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other problem I see a great deal of are tutorials that interleave <em>business logic</em>
		(what an application does) with <em>layout</em> (what an application looks like).
		This isn't wrong exactly, but having separation between the two does tend to make
		for systems that are more maintainable.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I'll assume that your development environment is set up. Here's what you will need:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Web server, usually Apache</li>
	<li>PHP; anything over 5.3.7 is fine, although the latest version is usually best</li>
	<li>SQLite PHP module</li>
</ul>

<p>
	For Windows users, you can get all of this with WAMP, and for Mac users you can install
	MAMP. If you use Linux, you may have all of this already. If you get stuck, turn to your favourite
	search engine, and ask "How do I install [whatever] on [Windows]". In 99% of cases, your question has
	already been answered, so be persistent.
</p>

<p>
	You'll also need an editor to modify files. Most computers have a free text editor already
	installed, but these are rarely good enough. Use whatever you like, but if you have no
	preference, download and install NetBeans.
</p>

<div class="intermission">~</div>

<p>
	In designing this tutorial, I wrote out a list of things I thought would be great to have, and
	then developed until I had a basic complete product. In retrospect, it would have been better to
	decide this prior to development; regardless of whether you are setting up a business or programming
	for fun, having a simple and achievable plan is miles better than an all-singing,
	all-dancing one that ends up abandoned half-way through (either through boredom, bankruptcy, or
	both).
</p>

<p>Here's the initial list of features/technologies I put on paper:</p>

<blockquote class="list">
	<p>
		Login, Logout, Add comment, Create user, Amend user, Delete user, Email validation for new user
		accounts, Display post, Accept markdown format, Create post, Edit post, Unpublish post, Delete post,
		Unit tests, List posts, AJAX posting/commenting, Database profiler, Internationalisation,
		Pretty URLs, Use template engine, Per-environment configuration files, Post pagination,
		Comment pagination, Unpublish comment, Delete comment, Foreign key constraints, Unique constraints,
		User access levels.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To illustrate how much an "initial working product" should trim the initial wishlist, here's
	what made it into the first version:
</p>

<blockquote class="list">
	<p>
		Login, Logout, Add comment, Display post, Create post, Edit post, Delete post, List posts,
		Delete comment, Foreign key constraints.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's worth pointing out that, with any software project, rejecting a feature <em>now</em> does
	not mean you can never add that feature. It just means that you are prioritising getting
	important things done, so that the product is in a releasable state quickly. Once it is out the
	door, you can then find a few more items on your list to add into the next iteration. In a
	commercial situation, this approach is helpful because if your users don't like a change you've
	made, you've wasted two months rather than two years &mdash; a saving that could be the difference
	between steering things back on track, and going bust.
</p>

<p>
	One of the other features of this tutorial is that it uses an absolute minimum of additional
	software to get it working. Software projects nearly always make use of libraries,
	each of which offer some particular pre-written functionality. These are well worth using in
	proper development, since they are better-tested by more people than an individual can usually
	achieve on their own. However, for a tutorial I think they can add integration complexity, and
	explaining the advanced-level code within is usually quite a distraction. Thus, I have eschewed
	libraries more than I would normally, and suspect this will be corrected in a second (more
	advanced) tutorial.
</p>
<p>
	I have made one exception for this rule, however, for reasons of password security. The login
	system requires some cryptographic code, and this sort of thing is quite easy to get wrong. Whilst
	this is just a tutorial, if it teaches readers to leave security to the experts (the
	library-writers), it has served a valuable purpose.
</p>

<div class="intermission">~</div>

<p>
	So, let us get started. I'll assume you know how to create, edit, save and delete files in your
	editor, and that you can create folders as required. This might be in the root of your "htdocs"
	or "www" folder, depending on what you used to install Apache. You can use a subfolder of "blog"
	if you wish, or for more advanced users, feel free to set up a new vhost. So, when I use
	<code>http://localhost/</code>, you can assume I am referring to the root of your project, even
	if your URL is somewhat different.
</p>

<p>
	Let us first check that your server installation is working okay. Create a file called
	<span class="filename">info.php</span> in the root of your project folder:
</p>

	<?php include '../templates/info.php' ?>

<p>
	Then, run this in your browser, by accessing the URL <code>http://localhost/info.php</code>.
	You should see a PHP configuration page. If you do, then check you are running a version later
	than 5.3.7; if it is earlier than this (e.g. it is still on 5.2, or an early version of 5.3) then
	you will need to upgrade. If you don't see this screen at all, then check that you have created
	the file in the right folder.
</p>

<p>
	Once you have this working, and showing an acceptable version number, you can delete this file.
</p>

<p>Here's the first bit of code to add:</p>

<div class="first">
	<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add skeleton front page') ?>
</div>

<p>
	This is the initial file, so all we have to do is copy and paste it in. To do so, create
	<span class="filename">index.php</span> in the root of your project folder, open it in your
	editor, and ensure it is empty before pasting in the code. Then visit
	<code>http://localhost/index.php</code> in your browser, to ensure that you can see the
	initial mock-up of our blog's home page.
</p>

<p>
	If you can, then your first piece of coding is done! The language is HTML, which is understood
	by your web browser as a way to describe documents on the web. HTML is not actually a
	programming language: it is properly referred to as a <em>markup language</em>. The markup itself
	is made up of <em>tags</em> such as <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, each
	of which has an opening tag (without the slash) and a closing tag (with the slash).

	These
	are nested to form a hierarchy in the same way as an ordinary letter is hierarchical: instead of
	an envelope containing a document containing headings and paragraphs, we have an
	<code>&lt;html&gt;</code> containing a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> containing
	<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. Easy peasy!
</p>

<blockquote class="sidebar">
	<div class="heading">
		<p>What do the tags mean?</p>
	</div>
	<ul>
		<li><code>DOCTYPE</code>: this tells the browser to expect a particular dialect of HTML
			&mdash; in this case HTML5</li>
		<li><code>html</code>: this is the "envelope" for the whole document. It acts as a container for
			everything</li>
		<li><code>head</code>: this contains stuff about the document, such as the title</li>
		<li><code>body</code>: unsurprisingly, this contains the main part of the document</li>
		<li><code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>: title headings of decreasing
			importance</li>
		<li><code>p</code>: a paragraph of text</li>
		<li><code>div</code>: a "division", i.e. a section</li>
		<li><code>a</code>: a hyperlink</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We'll use a few more as we go on, but those are the main ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Let us start improving our skeleton home page. One of the observations we can make is that there
	is a fair bit of repetition: there are two articles that both have a heading, date, summary
	and hyperlink. Since this is just test data, let us add a loop around the first article block
	and delete the second one.
</p>

<p>
	Here is how I am presenting the changes in this tutorial. This will be good practice for you,
	since all changes will be shown in this way. The approach of showing code changes like this is
	known as a <em>diff</em>, for obvious reasons (though the diffs I use are more colourful than
	the usual monochrome versions).
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Remove repetition and use a loop to generate dummy post data') ?>

<p>
	The rules for making these changes are simple: the code on the left is the old file, the code
	on the right is the new one; also, red lines are deleted, green lines are added. So, the two
	blocks on the left are in the existing file, and since they are red, they can be removed. The block
	on the right is green, so is added.
</p>
<p>
	Thus, if you wish, you can delete both article blocks and replace them with the new loop block
	(containing the <code>for()</code> through to the <code>endfor</code>). However, the way this was
	actually written was as follows:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Delete the second article</li>
	<li>Insert the start of the <code>for()</code> loop before the first article, on a new line</li>
	<li>Insert the end of the loop (<code>endfor</code>) at the end of the first article, on a new
		line</li>
	<li>Indent the contents of the loop (in most editors, you can do this by selecting the article
		markup and pressing the Tab key)</li>
	<li>Finally, the two snippets of PHP to output the <code>$postId</code> are inserted into the
		article
</ul>

<p>
	In summary, it doesn't matter too much how you apply these changes (or, indeed, any changes in
	this tutorial). That said, understanding the way in which changes are written in real
	life may help towards a greater understanding of the code. Don't worry though if you think you've
	made a mistake; the full file for each change is available above each one.
</p>

<blockquote class="sidebar">
	<div class="heading">
		<p>What are loops?</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		The <code>for()</code> and <code>endfor</code> you have seen form a <em>loop</em> block. This is
		a way of telling PHP that you want the enclosed code to be run a number of times. In this
		case, it sets a value to 1, and carries on looping whilst that value is less than or greater
		than 3. For each iteration of the loop, the value is incremented by 1, which is carried out by
		the <code>++</code> operator.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	So, finally, refresh your browser screen, and make sure your changes work. You should now see
	<em>three</em> articles, each with a different heading and paragraph.
</p>

<div class="intermission">~</div>

<p>
	The next step we will take is to set up the database. We'll use a database system called
	SQLite (pronounced "see-kwel light") as it is really easy to connect to, and does not
	require a database server. Create the following two files in your project, paste in the contents,
	and then we'll discuss what they do.
</p>

<p>
	You'll notice that some changes in this tutorial &mdash; including one of these files,
	<span class="filename">data/init.sql</span> &mdash; has a name that contains a forward slash.
	This means that the file is stored in a sub-directory, and that you'll need to create that
	manually if it does not already exist.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add data fixtures') ?>

<p>
	This change comprises of two new files, a SQL file and a PHP file. I'll discuss the SQL file
	first.
</p>

<blockquote class="sidebar">
	<div class="heading">
		<p>What is SQL?</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		SQL is a programming language for databases. It has been mostly standardised between different
		database systems, so it looks nearly the same regardless of whether you are connecting to
		MySQL or PostgreSQL or (as we are) SQLite. We will use it to set up our database initially,
		save information to our blog, and query information from our blog.
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Broadly, databases are stored in terms of <em>tables</em>, <em>columns</em> and <em>rows</em>. Each
	different kind of data we wish to store needs its own table, but to start with, we only have one:
	a post. The <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement specifies which properties we want a post to have,
	namely:
</p>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="note comment">
		Shall I rebase <code>user_id</code> out of the code until later? This might be confusing.
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<ul>
	<li>id: a unique identifier to help us tell posts apart</li>
	<li>title: the heading</li>
	<li>body: the main text of the article</li>
	<li>user_id: which user created the article</li>
	<li>created_at: when the article was created</li>
	<li>updated_at: when the article was updated</li>
</ul>

<p>
	A blog post is therefore just a row added to the posts table, since each row has space to store
	all of these values. Once the table is created, we also create some dummy article data, using
	<code>INSERT</code>. The format of this command, as used in the SQL script, is simply thus:
</p>

<p>
	<code>
		INSERT INTO table_name (column_1, column_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
	</code>
</p>

<p>
	Now, the SQL file won't do anything on its own: we need a program to send the commands to
	the database. This is where the <span class="filename">install.php</span> file comes in; we'll
	run that whenever we want to set up the blog (or to wipe it and start again). I'll describe
	its broad features here, but do also read the comments in the code.
</p>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="todo note">
		Re-running the installer on a fresh vhost just now resulted in permission errors when
		trying to create the file. Can we add a check in the script?
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<p>
	The first half of the code is written in PHP. Here, we use a series of <code>if()</code>
	statements to ensure everything goes smoothly. The variable <code>$error</code> is set to an
	error message if something goes wrong. Here are the steps we take:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensure the database has not been created in the <span class="filename">data.sqlite</span>
		file. If it has, we require the file to be deleted manually, so that it is harder to
		accidentally overwrite data.
	</li>
	<li>
		SQLite will work fine with just an empty file, so we create one with <code>touch()</code>
		and report if there was any problems doing that (such as being disallowed by file system
		permissions).
	</li>
	<li>
		We then read the SQL script in using <code>file_get_contents()</code> and report an error
		if the file cannot be found (this is unlikely, but it is good practice to check
		everything that can go wrong!).
	</li>
	<li>
		We then try running the SQL commands using <code>$pdo->exec()</code> and report any issues
		with that.
	</li>
	<li>
		Finally, we count the number of post rows we have created.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The second half of the file (from <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>) presents the results of
	the script, in HTML.
</p>
<p>So, if you have not already tried it, visit <code>http://localhost/install.php</code> in your
	browser, and make sure some posts are created. If you want to re-run it, delete the data.sqlite
	file manually and refresh your browser page.
</p>

__NEWFILE__

<h2>Using real data</h2>

<p>
	Since we now have some data in our database, we can change our home page to render that data, rather
	than the mock data it has now. It's worth noting though that the process of designing the page
	with dummy data hasn't been a waste of time; using a mock-up is often a valuable part of deciding what
	a page should contain, and where those elements should go. So, make these changes next:
</p>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="in-progress note">
		There's no value in adding <code>realpath()</code> to the code on line 4 (fixed in rebase1).
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Convert front page to read from database') ?>

<p>
	The first few lines determine the file path to the database, and then we create a new PDO object with
	<code>new PDO()</code>, which we can use to access the database. We then use the
	<code>query()</code> method to run a SQL statement that reads the posts from the database.
</p>

<blockquote class="sidebar">
	<div class="heading">
		<p>What is a SELECT statement?</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		The <code>SELECT</code> command is used to read from the database. For a single table, it takes a
		format like this:
	</p>
		
	<pre><code>SELECT
	(column names in a list)
FROM
	(table)
WHERE
	(condition)
ORDER BY
	(column names to sort on)</code></pre>

	<p>
		The <code>WHERE</code> is optional, and is useful if we want to filter on some particular
		feature of each row.
	</p>

	<p>The statement is often written on a single line, but it can be split up as here, for readability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	So, refresh your browser's view of <code>http://localhost/index.php</code>, and ensure that your
	new changes render the posts from the database without errors. I'll then explain what is happening.
</p>

<p>
	After connecting to the database, the query is used to retrieve column values for each table row,
	returning ordering the rows in <code>created_at DESC</code> (i.e. in reverse creation order, or most
	recent first). It then enters a loop (in this case a <code>while()</code>) to render all the posts it
	finds.
</p>

<p>
	We use <code>$stmt->fetch()</code> to read the next available row, until the point when there are no
	rows left. When that happens, this method will return false and the loop will exit.
</p>

<p>
	For every row, there are two observations worth making. Firstly, rows are returned in an array, so we
	access them using the array syntax such as <code>$row['title']</code>. Secondly, you'll see that
	where text strings are output, they are wrapped in the <code>htmlspecialchars()</code> function. The
	reason for this is that, if user input (a blog title or blog post in this case) contains angle brackets,
	it could break the HTML used in the page layout, and worse, might let a user inject unauthorised
	JavaScript that would be run on other people's computers.
</p>

<p>
	You'll notice that most of the PHP code to deal with the database side of things is in the top half
	of the file, and the second half is predominantly HTML. This isn't an accident: this arrangement creates
	a healthy separation between the two, which makes each easier to work with. Of course, there are a few
	cases where dynamic output is required inside the HTML, but these are kept deliberately short.
</p>

<div class="intermission">~</div>

<p>
	The next step is to create a page to show individual posts. Add the following file:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add post view page') ?>

<p>
	Now, it is our intention to link this page from individual posts on the home page. However, we've
	not quite done that bit yet, so let's visit the new page manually, in order to test it. Open a
	new tab, paste the link <code>http://localhost/view-post.php</code> into the address
	bar, and check that a simple post appears.
</p>

<p>
	
	The connection to the database is the same as before, but we now have a <code>WHERE</code> clause
	in our <code>SELECT</code> statement, and we are we are now using <code>prepare()</code> and
	<code>execute()</code> to send the statement to the database driver.
</p>
	
<p>
	Let's take the <code>WHERE</code> statement first. In the home page, we ran a query without
	this, because we wanted everything in the table. However it is more often the case that we
	want to limit returned rows to those matching one or more conditions. This is where the
	<code>WHERE</code> comes in. For our new page, we only want rows that have a specific id (and
	since "id" is unique, we know we won't get more than one).
</p>

<p>
	You'll notice that "id" is fixed to 1 (i.e. the first post). We'll fix that later, since of
	course this should depend on the post the user clicks on.
</p>

<p>
	The other change is swapping out the call to <code>query()</code> with two new methods.
	<code>prepare()</code> is used to set up the statement, and indicates with a colon where values
	should go (i.e. ":id"). The <code>execute()</code> statement then runs the query, swapping
	place-holders with real values (in this case, the number 1). This technique is known as
	<em>parameterisation</em>, and is a good way to inject user-supplied input in a secure manner
	(the post ID is not yet user-supplied, but it soon will be).
</p>

<p>
	In fact, let's wire in the post page now. Make the following changes, and test that clicking
	on each 'Read more' link shows the appropriate post.
</p>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="in-progress note">
		The code in <span class="filename">view-post.php</span> says the post ID is sanitised when
		it retrieved from GET, but this is not the case (fixed in rebase1).
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Wire in the view post page to the front page') ?>

<p>
	Alright, so let's make some nice easy changes now. A look at our
	<span class="filename">index.php</span> and <span class="filename">view-post.php</span>
	files shows that our blog title and synopsis is repeated in both files. That's not good, since
	if these things need to be amended, we need to change them more than once. Happily, the
	solution is easy: we create a PHP file for the duplicated snippet, and then use
	<code>require</code> to pull it in.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Centralise title section of page in an HTML fragment') ?>

<p>
	Once that is done, we can see there is still some duplication, this time with the database
	PHP code. So, let's fix that too! You'll notice here that we're using a subfolder for
	<span class="filename">lib</span>:
	this is a very common name for library code folders.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Centralise some database code') ?>

<p>
	The process of spotting code improvements (e.g. to reduce repetition) is known as
	<em>refactoring</em>, and it can be thought of as "cleaning as you go". Projects that are
	subject to these improvements are, at least in theory, more maintainable than ones that only
	get feature changes.
</p>

<blockquote class="sidebar">
	<div class="heading">
		<p>What is a function?</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		We saw in the <span class="filename">common.php</span> library a set of code blocks that
		start with the word
		<code>function</code>. These are named blocks of code that can be called from different
		places, and are an essential item in your toolkit. They help reduce duplication (since
		you don't need to write code again) and they help improve modularity (since functions
		can be stored in separate files).
	</p>

	<p>
		The functions we've seen here all provide a <em>return value</em>, which is the result of
		the function, and it can be of any type: a number, a string, whatever. This can either be
		printed out to the screen, or more frequently, stored in a variable at the place it is
		called. For example, the function <code>getRootPath()</code> gets the full directory
		name of your web project on disk.
	</p>
</blockquote>

__NEWFILE__

<h2>Adding more features</h2>

<p>
	It is normal practice to link the main heading of a website to the home page, as this makes
	for a consistent navigation experience. So, let's do that now:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Make title link to the home page') ?>

<p>
	Next, let us add in some logic that interprets two carriage-returns in a post as a paragraph
	break. Here we go:
</p>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="in-progress note">
		We have a closing <code>div</code> here that probably has only changed in whitespace terms.
		Remove this error (fixed in rebase1).
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Put in real paragraphs in the article view') ?>

<p>
	Now, the default date style used around the application isn't very readable, so let's
	improve that now:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Format the dates nicely') ?>

<p>
	Now we've done a bit of tidying, let's tackle a bigger item of functionality. We need
	to allow users to comment on articles, so let's make the necessary database changes to
	prepare for that:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add comments to fixtures') ?>

<p>
	Since this involves database changes, we'll need to delete our database file, and re-run
	the installer. So, delete the file in <span class="filename">data/data.sqlite</span> and then
	reinstall by visiting <code>http://localhost/install.php</code> again.
</p>

<p>
	You might ask why we are putting so much effort into an installer when we're nowhere
	near having a piece of finished software. The answer is that this installer is for us,
	the developers, and not for end users. Thus, it is something we want to set up reasonably
	early in our development lifecycle; whenever a database change is made, we want to be able
	to recreate our useful test data quickly and easily.
</p>

<p>
	Now we're ready to start adding some comment-related changes. To start with, let's add
	a count of comments on the front page. This uses the SQL command <code>COUNT()</code> to count
	the number of rows that would be returned by a query:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add comment counts to front page') ?>

<p>
	Also, we'll add a comment listing to individual post pages:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add comments/count to view post page') ?>

<p>
	So, give that a whirl. You will want to check the new count on the homepage, and the comments
	feature on individual posts. How's that looking?
</p>

<h2>Improving the installer</h2>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="comment note">
		I think the first person voice here is okay - the tutorial starts off with it, so it's
		consistent.
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<p>
	At this juncture, I decided to tidy up the installer a bit more. Firstly, it would be nice to
	see some data about what it has created; in the course of development you can expect
	to wipe and recreate your test data hundreds of times, so it's worth making the output
	useful.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, as it stands it demonstrates non-optimal techniques, and fixing that gives me an
	opportunity to explain how to improve upon it. Broadly, the problem is that visiting the URL
	changes the database, but it does not take into account that web addresses can receive visits
	from automated software (e.g. search engines looking for new websites). To be sure that it
	is a human who has requested an install, I've used a form with a "post" method (this is
	explained in more detail later).
</p>

<p>
	The changes here are quite substantial, so you may find it easier to download the file, and
	copy the whole thing over the top of the old version. So, here's the diff:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Get installer to install upon button press') ?>

<p>
	Finally, let's add some links so we can easily move to our next task after re-installing:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add helpful links in installer to home page, and self') ?>

<p>
	As is our custom, delete your database file and re-run the installer. This time you should
	have an "Install" button. All being well, it will do the same installation when you click it,
	and then you can opt to go straight to the blog's home page.
</p>

<div class="intermission">~</div>

<p>
	Since our changes to the installer have been brief, let's do some refactoring and a couple of
	minor functionality tweaks. Now, it could be said that this process of tidying seems rather
	erratic, and that similar items of work should be neatly collected together. However, real-life
	development rarely works that way: instead, a rough but usable solution is developed, and then
	improvements and refactorings are added depending on user feedback, and often also on time
	available.
</p>

<p>
	So, here's our first small improvement task. One of the things you may have noticed is that
	posts and comments are being marked as written on a particular day, but with no time
	information. It is usual to record and show this sort of data, so let's do that now. Don't
	forget to re-run the installer to test it!
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Convert all dates to datetimes') ?>

<p>
	Following on from our last bit of refactoring, here's another opportunity to tidy code. Arguably,
	the view post page has too much business logic in it, and it would be more maintainable
	to move this to a separate file. So, create <span class="filename">lib/view-post.php</span>
	and paste in the new content.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Refactor some business logic to separate library file') ?>

<p>
	One of the situations we have not yet catered for is the user requesting a blog article
	that does not exist. We need to handle that based on the maxim that "if something can go
	wrong, it will". There are a good few small changes here, but in essence our approach is
	that if we cannot find a database row, we issue a browser redirect and show an error.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Handle requests for non-existent posts') ?>

<p>
	Since the browser redirect is useful, it has been written as a function, and re-used by
	the installer. Although there is no new data to install, it is a good idea to delete your
	database file and re-install at this point, just to check it still works.
</p>

<h2>Commenting form</h2>

<p>
	Righto, let's get onto a new solid block of functionality: allowing users to add comments.
	This adds a new block of HTML in <span class="filename">comment-form.php</span>, which
	reports any errors when the comment is made, a form to capture the usual comment information,
	and some business logic in <span class="filename">lib/view-post.php</span> and
	<span class="filename">view-post.php</span> to glue it all together.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add basic commenting form, validation and db error handling') ?>

<p>
	Let us have a look in detail at <span class="filename">view-post.php</span>, which is the page
	called by the web server when a single post is rendered. In the newly inserted code, we take
	these actions:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Reset the errors variable to null i.e. we do not yet know if they are any errors.</li>
	<li>Detect if we are in a POST operation. If we are not (i.e. the page is just being rendered
		normally, rather than submitting a form) then don't do any more of this new stuff.</li>
	<li>Get the author name, website URL and comment message, and pass them to new
		function <code>addCommentToPost()</code> for validation and saving.</li>
	<li>This will return any resulting errors into the <code>$errors</code> array.</li>
	<li>If the comment-adding function successfully saves a comment to the database,
		redirect to self and exit. This will request the page again in GET mode.</li>
	<li>If the comment save failed (perhaps because a mandatory field was not supplied) then
		the errors array will contain the error message(s). Since this skips the
		redirection phase, the form is rendered within the same call, which allows the errors
		to be marked on the form.</li>
</ol>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="comment note">
		If we get stuck for space, we could move this sidebar to the earlier
		place where we refactored the installer from GET to POST.
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<div class="sidebar">
	<div class="heading">
		<p>What are GET and POST?</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		I've used these phrases a few times without explaining them, so let me do that now. GET and
		POST are two kinds of <strong>HTTP operation</strong>, and can be thought of rather like a
		mode that a web-connected device (like a browser or a server) operates in. Any web address
		can be visited in either mode, and the web application can take a different course of
		action depending on the mode used.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we visit a web site normally &mdash; such as the home page of our blog, say &mdash;
		we are in GET mode. This is the state that is suitable for <em>reading</em> things from
		a web server. Some pages containing a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> also operate in GET mode,
		such as search forms, since these too are used to read information.
	</p>
	<p>
		Forms that may result in data being saved, on the other hand, should use POST. You can
		see this with the comment form we just installed; have a look for the
		<code>method="post"</code> declaration in the form tag.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was one of the reasons behind the earlier change to the installer: before the
		modification, visiting the URL would reset the database, which breaks the rule that GET
		operations are only for reading data. Swapping this to a POST form solved the issue.
	</p>
</div>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="comment note">
		I've added this hash deliberately in the wrong order - I felt it was best to do this before the
		validation failure thing. In the long term maybe it would be simpler just to merge this
		with the code that introduces the feature?
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<p>
	Adding a comment doesn't work yet, as the <code>INSERT</code> command is missing a value for
	the date of comment creation. Let's fix that now:
</p>
	
<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add timestamp to insert so comment device works') ?>

<p>
	So, that gets the success case working. However, if you test a failure condition (empty name
	field or an empty comment, the fields that <em>were</em> filled in now disappear. This is because
	a form does not by default contain values, so we have to add them manually.	
</p>

<p>
	Thus, we now set empty values for the GET case (no form submission) in
	<span class="filename">view-post.php</span> as well as
	the already existing POST case. Where we output the user-supplied data, we pass it through
	the PHP function <code>htmlspecialchars()</code>, which prevents any rendering problems if the
	user has used any HTML characters such as angle brackets.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Persist comment form data in case of validation') ?>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="comment note">
		These last five items are refactoring/tidying. If this page gets too long, we could move
		a couple of them to the next page?
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<p>
	And now for some more tidying. The first tweaking opportunity I noticed was that the code to
	make a comment safe to render to the screen, and to swap newlines for paragraph tags, might be
	useful elsewhere in the future. So I've generalised that snippet of code in a function, and
	then made use of it:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Render paragraphs in comments') ?>

<p>
	A nice simple one is up next. The code for <span class="filename">install.php</span> was
	rather bloated by the presence of the
	large function at the start, and there's no reason why this couldn't be stored separately,
	making the installer page easier to maintain. We refactored this one a while ago, but it's
	perfectly fine to refactor again &mdash; the process can be regarded as fairly iterative
	anyway. So here's the diff, resulting in new file
	<span class="filename">lib/install.php</span>:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Move install logic to separate file') ?>

<p>
	When a comment is created, we use a snippet of code to create a timestamp in a format suitable
	for the database server. Since that'll be useful for other things, let's convert that to a
	reusable function:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Refactor SQL timestamp into new func, we\'ll need this next') ?>

<p>
	I noticed that the installer creates its own database connection. Although there was no
	pressing need to do so, I modified it so it uses a connection passed to it. This would make it
	easier to run automated tests against it, for example &mdash; a custom test connection would be
	passed to it, rather than the "hard-wired" one we have now removed.
</p>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="todo note">
		The commit contains more than the comment describes - there is an additional
		check on the database file size. Can we rebase this into the code earlier?
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Send PDO object to create db function') ?>

<p>
	The last tweak is very easy: a re-reading of some of the code showed that I'd not updated
	a comment in line with a code change. Now, I could magic this away for the benefit of the
	tutorial, but I rather like the opportunity to show that code is never perfect, and that
	sometimes comments come out of sync with what they're meant to describe! So, just apply the
	following diff, and we're done for this chapter.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Fix up out-of-date comment') ?>

__NEWFILE__

<h2>Adding a login system</h2>

<p>
	The next thing I decided to implement was a log-on system. This will allow a blog administrator
	to write, edit and delete posts, and to delete comments. In this set of changes, I add a
	users table, and allow the installer to create an admin user with a new password each time it
	is run. So, make the following changes, and then re-create the database:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add user table, create user row when installing') ?>

<p>
	There are two fields in the new user table that I added based on my experience rather than an
	immediate need. These are <code>created_at</code>, which holds the date and time when the user
	was first set up, and <code>is_enabled</code>, which allows us to turn users on and off. Most
	user systems will find a practical use for these simple features during their lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	You'll have noticed a comment in <span class="filename">lib/install.php</span> noting that
	the password is stored in plaintext.
	This means that, as it stands, passwords would be stored literally, which is considered to be
	very bad practice indeed. What we should do is to store passwords in an encoded, non-reversible
	format, so that even if they are stolen they will be nearly impossible to read. This acts as a
	form of protection should a cracker get through our security and steal our database.
</p>

<p>
	So, let's make that improvement straight away. To do so, we'll need the library I talked about
	at the start of the tutorial, stored here in <span class="filename">vendor/password_compat</span>.
	The features it provides are so useful they have been built into PHP 5.5, so if you are running
	this version (or later) you can skip adding the new file. However if you are running an earlier
	version, or if you are not sure which version you have, copy it into place.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add password hashing capability') ?>

<p>
	So, what does the new code do? It makes use of a new function called
	<code>password_hash()</code>, which takes a password as input and produces what is known as a
	<em>hash</em>. A hash is a mathematical calculation that is strictly one way, which means that
	if sometimes steals our database of password hashes, they will find it very difficult indeed
	to recreate the passwords they were generated from.
</p>

<p>
	Whether or not you are using it, by all means do have a read of the source code in
	<span class="filename">password.php</span>. However, an in-depth exploration of it would be rather
	advanced at this stage, so for our purposes we will assume it just works.
</p>

<p>
	The next step is to add a login form, and a link from which to access it:
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add skeleton for login screen') ?>

<p>
	In the next change, we add our familiar block of business logic before the main HTML. In this
	case, it checks to see if the form has been submitted; if it has, then it turns on the
	session system (more about that in a minute), creates a hash of the submitted password,
	and compares it with the hash stored in the database.
</p>

<p>
	If the user gets their username wrong (e.g. it is not found) or the password wrong (the
	password hash does not match the one for the username supplied) then we regard this as a login
	failure. It is important for us not to be too helpful here (such as explaining that a username
	does not exist), as this information might be useful to a system cracker.
</p>

<p>
	If the password matches however, then we call <code>login()</code> to sign in the user, and
	then we redirect to the home page using <code>redirectAndExit()</code>.
</p>

<blockquote class="sidebar">
	<div class="heading">
		<p>What are sessions?</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Sessions are an extremely useful feature that allow web applications to
		remember per-user information. By default, every request to the server is seen in
		isolation, so without sessions, an application would not be able to
		remember that a user had signed in, or what their username was.
	</p>

	<p>
		To make sessions work, PHP sends the user's browser a cookie containing a random
		identifier, and for every subsequent visit, the browser supplies this back to the server.
		This identifier corresponds to a file on the server containing the variables that have been
		set for each user.
	</p>

	<p>
		PHP makes this nice and simple for developers: we just turn on sessions using
		<code>session_start()</code>, and then we can just read and write to the
		<code>$_SESSION</code> array. Easy peasy!
</blockquote>

<p>
	So, with that explained, let's add the changes:
</p>

<?php if (showTodoMessages()): ?>
	<div class="todo note">
		Oops, we'll need to rebase in a code change to only load the library if the PHP version is
		&lt;5.5, otherwise the <code>require()</code> will bomb out!
	</div>
<?php endif ?>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Get login system mainly working') ?>

<p>
	Now we have a way to determine whether users are logged in or not, let's switch that feature
	on for all pages. Here we also modify the HTML snippet that contains the page header, so
	it can show the appropriate login/logout link.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Switch on sessions in all pages, recognise logged in/out') ?>

<p>
	You may have noticed, if you tried the logout link, that this page does not yet exist. So let's
	add that now in the following set of changes. Whilst we are at it, let's greet the user by
	their username while they are logged in, as this makes the experience of the site a bit
	more friendly.
</p>

<?php renderDiffFromComment('Add logout and username greeting') ?>

<p>
	That's all for this chapter, so give your application a good test, especially the new
	login and logout features. When you're ready, we'll proceed in the next chapter with some 
	small tweaks to improve what we have.
</p>
